	<h1>Using the OMAS Dashboard</h1>
	<p>
		If this page and the inline help resources do not answer all of your questions about the OMAS dashboard,
			please email us at <a href="omas@osumc.edu?subject="OMAS Dashboard">omas@osumc.edu</a>.
	</p>
	<h2>System Requirements</h2>
	<p>
		The OMAS Dashboards are optimized for use in Mozilla Firefox and Google's Chrome browser. Content may appear differently in other browsers.
		<br />
		The dashboard's interactive interface depends on JavaScript, which is built into your web browser.
			However, some organizations disable JavaScript or block certain kinds of content.
				<a href="https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/is-javascript-enabled">Check whether JavaScript is enabled in your browser</a>.
	</p>
	<h2>Inline Help</h2>
	<p>
		The OMAS Dashboard has help icons that provide additional information about all the dashboard's components.
			Hover your mouse over the <img src="purplehelp.png"> icons to learn more about what a component does.
	</p>
	<h2>Filtering Results</h2>
	<p>
		Filters constrain results to a selected subpopulation. Plots and tables will automatically redraw to reflect your choices.
		<br />
		The age and income filters are 'inclusive' - for example, selecting an age range of 25-64 will <strong>include</strong> 25 year-olds and 64 year-olds.
		<br />
		Filters apply cumulatively: For example, selecting the subpopulation <em>Females</em> and an age range of 25-64 will constrain the analysis to persons who are female and who are between 25 and 64 years of age.
	</p>
	<h2>Stratifying Results</h2>
	<p>
		Stratifying results allows you to compare results across values of a variable, such as comparing results for different types of insurance coverage.
	</p>
	<h2>Confidence Intervals</h2>
	<p>
		The 'I'-shaped line at the top of each bar or dot represents the 90% Confidence Interval for the estimate shown.
			This <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/saipe/guidance/confidence-intervals.html">US Census Bureau page</a> discusses what Confidence Intervals are and how to interpret them. 
	</p>
	<h2>Blank Rows in Tables and Plots</h2>
	<p>
		When the precision of the estimates is too low, typically because the sample size for the estimate is too small,
			results are hidden from view or are replaced with N/A. For an estimate to be displayed, all of the following must be satisfied:
		<ul>
			<li>The denominator of a univariate estimate contains responses from 30 or more respondents;</li>
			<li>The numerator of a univariate estimate contains responses from 5 or more respondents;</li>
			<li>The relative standard error (RSE) of survey-weighted estimates is 50% or lower.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<h2>Notes on Variables</h2>
	<p>
		Variables used in the OMAS Adult dashboard are documented <a href="http://grcapps.osu.edu/dashboards/OMAS/adult/Sourcevars-Adult.pdf">here</a>.
		<!-- Need to fix this link for the new version and the constraints imposed by flexdashboard -->
	</p>
	<h3>Age</h3>
	<p>
		Results are available for respondents ages 0-17 in the Child dashboard, and ages 19 and older in the Adult dashboard. Respondents 18 years are not included, they were sampled as adults in the 2004, 2008 and 2010 surveys and as children in the 2012, 2015 and 2017 surveys. 18 year-old respondents are included in the <a href="http://grc.osu.edu/OMAS">downloadable OMAS series data</a>.
	</p>
	<h3>Income</h3>
	<p>
		Household income is presented as a percentage of the <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/federal-poverty-level-fpl/">Federal Poverty Level (FPL)</a> for the year prior to the one in which the survey was conducted. That is, in the 2015 survey respondents were asked about their 2014 household income for the year.
