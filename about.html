	<h2>About the OMAS</h2>
	<p>
		The Ohio Medicaid Assessment Survey Series is administered by the Ohio Department of Medicaid with the assistance of the Ohio Colleges of Medicine Government Resource Center (GRC). The OMAS is a critical research data set for assessing Ohioans' access to and use of clinical health care, insurance status, chronic and acute conditions, mental health, and health status stressors such as poverty, joblessness, and low socioeconomic status. It is a telephone survey that samples both landline and cellphones in Ohio.
		<br />
		The survey examines access to the health system, health status, and health determinant characteristics of Ohio's Medicaid, Medicaid-eligible, and non-Medicaid populations. OMAS is an important tool to help the Ohio Department of Medicaid and its fellow state agencies identify gaps in needed health services, develop strategies to increase service capacity, and monitor Ohioans' health status and health risk.
		<br />
